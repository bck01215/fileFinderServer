# fileFinderServer

## What it does?

Finds all files in provided path (including sub-directories and their files) and displays them in a gui

## How to use it?

### Requirements

Before you build anything you need to make sure you have a compatible version of go (go 1.19).
You will also need yarn to build the frontend.

### Use

If you run `make server` this will build the application. Static files will be in `./static` and the executable will be `./fileFinderServer`.
If you run `make run`, it will do everything `make server` does and then start the application.
